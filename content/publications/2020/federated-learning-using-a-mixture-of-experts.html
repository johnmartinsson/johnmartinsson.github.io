abstract: "In this work, we present a federated learning approach using a mixture of experts. The method leverages the strengths of multiple models to improve the overall performance and robustness of the system. By distributing the learning process across different devices, we ensure data privacy and scalability. The proposed approach is evaluated on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in different scenarios."
